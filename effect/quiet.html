      <h1>Accidental layer creation</h1>

      <p>
        Click the box above, it spins, woo! Click somewhere else, it stops, boo!
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Take a close look at this text when you start and stop the box spinning, it changes ever so slightly, you may have to zoom in to see it. It's losing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpixel_rendering">subpixel antialiasing</a>. This is a symptom of text getting its own texture layer on the GPU.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Fire up this page in <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/chrome/browser/canary.html">Chrome Canary</a>, and turn on "Show composited layer borders" in devtools settings. You'll see the text getting an orange border when the box is spinning, confirming its getting its own texture-backed layer.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Aside from the minor text rendering change, this isn't a big deal on desktop, creating textures and uploading to the GPU is pretty cheap. However, mobile devices often don't have such a friendly relationship with the GPU, and texture creation isn't as cheap.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Why is this happening?</h2>
      
      <p>
        The box has <code>position: relative</code>, but so do the headings and paragraphs. This means the headings and paragraphs are layered above the box. When the box get its own texture-backed layer, by starting a transform-based animation, anything that could appear on top of it must also get a texture-backed layer, as layers without one cannot be rendered on top.
      </p>
      
      <h2>How do I fix it?</h2>
      
      <p>
        Simple! Just make sure elements that are likely to get a texture-backed layer appear on top of ones that won't. In this case, pop into devtools and give the box <code>z-index: 1</code>. Now the font rendering remains the same whether the box is animating or not, and the text doesn't need its own layer on the GPU.
